## Getting your radio programmed

In the [Mononoke village](https://ohm2013.org/wiki/Village:Mononoke) we'll have
some programming cables available to get your portable radio programmed. We
should be able to program most Kenwood-plug type radios. Mind you that this is
completely at your own risk and we take no responsibility if your radio gets
damaged, it's always best to bring your own programming cable certified for
your brand and type of radio.
